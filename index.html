<h1>TCR Manifesto</h1>

<p>We have reached a point in software engneering profession where we recognize the futility of manipulating computing machinery indirectly. The biggest issue in software engineering/computer programming today is the seemingly inevitable <em>delayed feedback</em>. We make a diff and then have to wait and jump through some hoops until we see the effects of that diff.</p>

<p>This delayed feedback is creating a number of issues, from bugs and defects in the code to bloated and unnecessarily complex ecosystem surrounding the running code.</p>

<p>To remedy this problem, we are embracing <strong>TCR</strong> (<strong>T</strong>est-<strong>C</strong>ommit-or-<strong>R</strong>eset) approach. In a nutshell, we prefer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Committing code on every save over committing code after tests pass</li>
<li>Mutation testing over some arbitrary code coverage</li>
<li>Hard reset on failing test over testing framework notifying us that test(s) are in red</li>
<li>Avoid using copy & paste/undo over mechanically copying code</li>
</ul>
